# Dart Utilities Project

This project demonstrates various Dart utilities including string manipulation, collections, file handling, and date/time operations. It also includes a combined application that utilizes all these utilities.

## Prerequisites

- Dart SDK (version 2.12.0 or higher)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd dart_utilities
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   dart pub get
   ```

## Running the Programs

Each utility can be run individually using the Dart CLI. Here's how to run each program:

1. String Manipulation:
   ```
   dart run string-manipulation.dart
   ```

2. Collections Demo:
   ```
   dart run collections_demo.dart
   ```

3. File Handling:
   ```
   dart run file-handling.dart
   ```

4. Date and Time Operations:
   ```
   dart run date-time.dart
   ```

5. Combined Application:
   ```
   dart run app.dart
   ```

## Utilities Overview

1. **String Manipulation**: Demonstrates string concatenation, interpolation, substring extraction, case conversion, string reversal, and length calculation.

2. **Collections**: Shows the usage of lists, sets, and maps, including adding, removing, and iterating over items.

3. **File Handling**: Illustrates reading from and writing to files, as well as error handling during file operations.

4. **Date and Time Operations**: Showcases the use of Dart's DateTime class for formatting, parsing, and manipulating dates.

5. **Combined Application**: A small application that combines all the above utilities. It takes user input, manipulates strings, stores results in a collection, saves data to a file, and logs the time of each entry.
